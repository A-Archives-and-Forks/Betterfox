# BetterFox
about:config tweaks to enhance [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ "Firefox Homepage"). Files are updated as needed for your [user.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file).


## Simple goals:
1) **Minimalism:** get what isn't needed out of the way
2) **Efficiency:** unleash Firefox's ability to be fast and performant
3) **Security:** sensible privacy and security without causing site breakage


## Simple configs:
   
| List      | Description |
|:---------:|-------------|
| [Fastfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/FastFox.js)   | Immensely increase Firefox's browsing speed. Give Chrome a run for its money!|
| [PeskyFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/PeskyFox.js)  | Unclutter the new tab page. Remove Pocket and form autofill. Prevent Firefox from serving annoying webpage notifications.|
| [SmoothFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/SmoothFox.js) | Get Microsoft Edge-like smooth scrolling on your favorite browser|
| [SecureFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/SecureFox.js) | Remove Telemetry, Mozilla experiments, Google Safe Browsing, and search engine suggestions in URL bar. Auto-upgrade mixed content to HTTPS. Various privacy enhancements. |
| [LiteFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/LiteFox.js) | All the essentails without any of the breakage. Use these preferences as your foundation to add to each category as desired, or use it by itself. |
| [user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/user.js) | Unified list, minus some of my personal preferences. Users may download this list as their own user.js. |

## Who is this setup for?
**If you want a secure, blazing fast browsing experience, and don't want to deal with breakage, this setup is for you.** My objective is to make the defaults sufficient enough for the average privacy-minded user, but remain trouble-free enough that my grandmother could use it. <strike>(That puts a whole new twist on being a foxy grandma!)</strike> Edit: Sorry for the dad joke üòì


## about:Privacy
**A note to hardcore privacy users:** I made [SecureFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Better-Fox/blob/master/SecureFox.js) as private as I could, up to the point of experiencing breakage. My guiding principle was: "If it breaks it, it doesn't make it!" So things like WebGL and DRM are still enabled, and you won't find settings like `privacy.firstparty.isolate` or `network.http.referer.XOriginPolicy` mentioned here. BetterFox is designed to set-and-forget, not to troubleshoot and tinker. You can [compare different user.js files here](https://yokoffing.github.io/compare-user.js/).

TL;DR: If your threat level calls for anonymity and not just reasonable privacy, please use the [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org). üëç

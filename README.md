# BetterFox
about:config tweaks to enhance [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ "Firefox Homepage"). Files are updated as needed for your [user.js](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file).


## Simple goals
1) **Minimalism:** get what isn't needed out of the way
2) **Efficiency:** unleash Firefox's ability to be fast and performant
3) **Security:** sensible privacy and security without causing site breakage


## Simple configs
   
| List      | Description |
|:---------:|-------------|
| [Fastfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/master/FastFox.js)   | Immensely increase Firefox's browsing speed. Give Chrome a run for its money!|
| [SecureFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/master/SecureFox.js) | Remove Telemetry, Mozilla experiments, Google Safe Browsing, and search engine suggestions in URL bar. Auto-upgrade mixed content to HTTPS. Various privacy enhancements. |
| [PeskyFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/master/PeskyFox.js)  | Unclutter the new tab page. Remove Pocket and form autofill. Prevent Firefox from serving annoying webpage notifications. |
| [SmoothFox](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/master/SmoothFox.js) | Get Microsoft Edge-like smooth scrolling on your favorite browser. |
| [user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/master/user.js) | All the essentails. None of the breakage. Users may download this list as their own user.js. |
| [LibreWolf.Overrides.cfg](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/master/librewolf.overrides.cfg) | Do you prefer [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)? Well, here's a few [overrides](https://librewolf.net/docs/settings/) to enhance your favorite Firefox fork! |

## Who is this setup for?
**If you want a secure, blazing fast browsing experience, and don't want to deal with breakage, this setup is for you.** My objective is to make the defaults sufficient enough for the average privacy-minded user, but remain trouble-free enough that my grandmother could use it. <strike>(That puts a whole new twist on being a foxy grandma!)</strike> Edit: Sorry for the dad joke ðŸ˜“

## about:Privacy
My guiding principle was: "If it breaks it, it doesn't make it!" So things like WebGL and DRM are still enabled, and you won't find a setting like `privacy.resistFingerprinting` mentioned here ([why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/wuqpgi/are_there_any_aboutconfig_tweaks_to_get_smooth/ile3whx/?context=3)). BetterFox is designed to set-and-forget, not to troubleshoot and tinker. You can compare different user.js files [here](https://jm42.github.io/compare-user.js).

BetterFox was created with a [less is more](https://medium.com/the-mission/less-is-more-the-minimum-effective-dose-e6d56625931e) mentality (i.e., keeping in mind [the law of diminishing returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp)). Most repos I've encountered have niche privacy and security concerns with little regard for speed, annoyances, or mainstream use. The average user doesn't need all `prefs` altered to get the results they want.

## Assumptions
That being said, BetterFox does make some assumptions: 
* **Google Safe Browsing** (GSB) is disabled. Please use DNS-level protection like [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=xujj63g5), and check out our configuration guide [here](https://github.com/yokoffing/NextDNS-Config).
   * If you don't have other means of protection, then enable GSB locally by [adding these prefs](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/b354f21405fcfedee8ae9a132eac8d243b59ced7/SecureFox.js#L974-L983) to the bottom of your `user.js`.
* The native **password manager** is also disabled. If you don't use something like [KeePass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/), [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/), or [1Password](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager), then add [these prefs](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/b354f21405fcfedee8ae9a132eac8d243b59ced7/SecureFox.js#L734-L736) to re-enable native password management.
* **Firefox Sync** is disabled. Change [this pref](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/b354f21405fcfedee8ae9a132eac8d243b59ced7/SecureFox.js#L989-L992) to `true` and add it to your overrides, or use a addon like [xBrowserSync](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xbs/).
* BetterFox [allows](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/eb0b47f40d18be328b9e499163ae199e7f2ef91e/SecureFox.js#L48-L55) for **embedded tweets, instagram, and reddit posts** to load on webpages, even though these requests are blocked by default when using Firefox's **Strict** Tracking Protection. To revert this behavior, add [these prefs](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/blob/5d16f192d4c7fb36cf723f2aedf118bc62bfd115/SecureFox.js#L62-L65) to the bottom of your `user.js`.
   * We suggest that you [selectively allow](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide) these requests in uBlock Origin with [medium mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode) enabled as well as add the [Privacy Essentials](https://github.com/yokoffing/filterlists/blob/main/PrivacyEssentials.txt) filter to your [custom lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists#3rd-party-filter-lists).
* You should have [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/wiki/uBlock-Origin), [AdGuard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adguard-adblocker/), or [Ghostery](https://github.com/yokoffing/BetterFox/wiki/Ghostery) for browser-level content blocking.
* If your threat level calls for _anonymity_ and not just reasonable _privacy,_ please use the [TOR browser](https://www.torproject.org). :thumbsup:
